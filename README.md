Project Overview
This project aims to predict the success of fashion products using machine learning techniques. It compares the performance of three different models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project includes data preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
The main objectives of this project are:

To preprocess and analyze historical product data
To train and optimize multiple machine learning models for product success prediction
To compare the performance of different models and identify the best approach
To provide insights into the most important features for predicting product success

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/product-success-prediction.git
cd product-success-prediction

Create and activate a virtual environment:
Copypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install required packages:
Copypip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow matplotlib seaborn

Verify the installation:
Copypython -c "import pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn; print('All packages installed successfully')"


Data Description
The project uses a dataset named historic.csv, which should be placed in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook. The dataset contains the following features:

item_no: Unique identifier for each product
category: Product category
main_promotion: Main promotion type used for the product
color: Product color
stars: Customer rating (0-5 stars)
success_indicator: Target variable (1 for successful products, 0 for unsuccessful)

Additional features may be present in the dataset. The preprocessing step handles various data types and prepares the data for model training.
Methodology
The project follows these main steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Loading the data from historic.csv
Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding
Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler
Splitting the data into training and testing sets


Model Training and Tuning:

Training three different models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN
Performing hyperparameter tuning for each model
Evaluating model performance using accuracy and classification report


Model Comparison:

Comparing the performance of all three models
Visualizing the results using bar plots and feature importance charts


Feature Importance Analysis:

Analyzing feature importance for Random Forest and XGBoost models
Visualizing the top 10 most important features for each model



Model Architecture
Random Forest

Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
Hyperparameters tuned: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf

XGBoost

Gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance and speed
Hyperparameters tuned: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, colsample_bytree

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Multi-layer perceptron with dense layers and dropout for regularization
Architecture: Input Layer -> Dense(64) -> Dropout -> Dense(32) -> Dropout -> Dense(16) -> Output Layer
Hyperparameters tuned: neurons, dropout_rate, learning_rate, batch_size, epochs

Hyperparameter Tuning

Random Forest and XGBoost: GridSearchCV is used to perform an exhaustive search over specified parameter values.
ANN: A manual grid search is implemented to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

The hyperparameter grids for each model are defined in the notebook and can be adjusted as needed.
Results and Interpretation
The notebook generates several outputs to help interpret the results:

Model Accuracy: The accuracy of each model on the test set is reported and compared.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class are provided for all models.
Feature Importance: Bar plots showing the top 10 most important features for Random Forest and XGBoost models.
Model Comparison Plot: A bar plot comparing the accuracy of all three models.

Interpret these results to understand which model performs best for your specific dataset and which features are most predictive of product success.
Usage Guide

Ensure the historic.csv file is in the project directory.
Open Jupyter Notebook:
Copyjupyter notebook

Open model_selection.ipynb.
Run each cell sequentially, following the comments and markdown explanations.
After execution, review the output, plots, and printed results to understand model performance and feature importance.

Troubleshooting

Missing Packages: If you encounter ModuleNotFoundError, ensure all required packages are installed using the provided installation command.
Memory Issues: For large datasets, you may need to increase your system's swap space or use a machine with more RAM.
Runtime Warnings: Some warnings about future deprecations may appear. These generally don't affect the current functionality but note them for future updates.
